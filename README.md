# universal-es6-redux-react-semantic
A sane and working boilerplate for univeral redux/react apps using Semantic UI in ES6 by [Chris Abouabdo](https://github.com/christopherabouabdo) and [Rudy Chaney](https://github.com/rudeluv) @ [FOODBEAST](https://github.com/Foodbeast)

## The Stack
- Babel for ES6
- Webpack... to pack
- Express for server-side loading
- Redux to manage state
- React for our UI components
- Semantic UI for compoenent styling and behavior
- Helmet for head tag control

** Optional Things **
- Axiom inside reducers to interact with REST Apis for data

## Our Process
We were looking for a way to build client apps that could:
1. Interface easily with a REST API
2. Render initial loads server-side
3. Have granular, but simple meta and head tag control
4. Actually work when we `npm start` it
